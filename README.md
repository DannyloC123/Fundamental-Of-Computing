I thought it would be cool to place any interesting projects that I do during this class on this repo.

So far the most interesting is a Crossword Puzzle Generator.


## Fractals Project
This project generates eight different recursive fractals using gfx.h and event-driven graphics.
Each fractal corresponds to keyboard input (1–8), and the window updates instantly based on the key pressed.

Sierpinski Triangle

Shrinking Squares

Spiral Squares

Circular Lace

Snowflake (recursive 6-way pattern)

Recursive Tree

Fern

Spiral of Spirals

All fractals are drawn recursively, stopping when the scale becomes too small.
