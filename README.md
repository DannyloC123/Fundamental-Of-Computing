# Fundamentals of Computing (Fund Comp)

I thought it would be cool to place any interesting projects that I do during this class on this repo.

So far the most interesting is a Crossword Puzzle Generator.


## Fractals Project
This project generates eight different recursive fractals using gfx.h and event-driven graphics.
Each fractal corresponds to keyboard input (1–8), and the window updates instantly based on the key pressed.

Fractals Implemented

Sierpinski Triangle

Shrinking Squares

Spiral Squares

Circular Lace

Snowflake (recursive 6-way pattern)

Recursive Tree

Fern

Spiral of Spirals

All fractals are drawn recursively, stopping when the scale becomes too small.
